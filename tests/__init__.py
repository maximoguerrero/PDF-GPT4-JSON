"""
__init__.py

This module is the package initializer for the current Python package.

It's often used to perform setup needed for the package (like import statements). 
It can be left empty but it must be present in the directory to let Python know 
that the directory is a package.

In this case, it's currently empty. If any package-level setup is needed, it can be added here.
